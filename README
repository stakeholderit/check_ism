About this program
==================

check_openmanage is a plugin for Nagios which checks the hardware
health of Dell PowerEdge and some PowerVault servers. It uses the Dell
OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) software, which must be running
on the monitored system. check_openmanage can be used remotely with
SNMP or locally with NRPE, check_by_ssh or similar, whichever suits
your needs and particular taste. The plugin checks the health of the
storage subsystem, power supplies, memory modules, temperature probes
etc., and gives an alert if any of the components are faulty or
operate outside normal parameters.

The plugin can give performance data with the '-p' or '--perfdata'
switch. Performance data collected include temperatures, fan speeds
and power usage (on servers that support it).

Storage components checked:

* Controllers
* Physical drives
* Logical drives
* Cache batteries
* Enclosures
* Enclosure fans
* Enclosure power supplies
* Enclosure temperature probes
* Enclosure management modules (EMMs)

Chassis components checked:

* Processors
* Memory modules
* Cooling fans
* Temperature probes
* Power supplies
* Batteries
* Voltage probes
* Power usage
* Chassis intrusion
* Sane and not empty service tag (serial number)

Other:

* ESM Log health
* ESM Log content (default disabled)
* Alert Log (default disabled, not SNMP)

check_openmanage will identify blades and will not report "missing"
power supplies, cooling fans etc. on blades. It will also accept that
other components are "missing", unless for components that should be
present in all servers. For example, all servers should have at least
one temperature probe, but not all servers have logical drives
(depends on the type and configuration of the controller).

This nagios plugin is designed to be used by either NRPE or with
SNMP. It is written in perl. In NRPE mode, it uses omreport to display
status on various hardware components. In SNMP mode, it checks the
same components as with omreport. Output is parsed and reported in a
Nagios friendly way.
