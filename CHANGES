0.0.1-beta 2025-04-02
---------------------

* Initial release of the plugin rewritten for iDRAC Service Module
  based on the original check_openmanage plugin v3.7.13-beta as it
  was available from https://github.com/trondham/check_openmanage
  in the beginning of 2025.

* The forked and update project is now called check_ism and the
  plugin is called check_ism to reflect that now it is based on
  iDRAC Service Module and not OpenManage Server Administrator
  (OMSA).
  In fact OMSA is not supported anymore and the iDRAC Service
  Module is the only supported way to monitor Dell hardware.

  Please see Dells documentation for more information about the
  iDRAC Service Module and how to enable it on your Dell hardware
  and how to install Service Module in the OS.

* The plugin is currently not available in the Nagios Exchange,
  but will hopefully be available there in the future.
